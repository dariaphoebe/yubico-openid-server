Yubico OpenID Server
====================

This is a fork of the yubico-openid-server available at [1].
	
Instead of the outdated version of php-openid used in the upstream project,
this is based on the current php-openid master[2] as of 2013-02-07. It also
adds a script to generate a tarball that can be copied to the webserver and
deployed there (which also includes the latest master of php-yubico).

To install this, see [3] and start where you create config.php.
