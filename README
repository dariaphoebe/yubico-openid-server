Yubico OpenID Server
====================

This is a fork of the yubico-openid-server available at
http://code.google.com/p/yubico-openid-server/. Instead of the outdated version of php-openid used
in the upstream project, this is based on the current php-openid master at
https://github.com/openid/php-openid as of 2013-02-07. It also adds a script to generate a tarball
that can be copied to the webserver and deployed there (which also includes the latest master of
php-yubico).

To install this, see http://code.google.com/p/yubico-openid-server/wiki/ReadMeYubico and start where
you create config.php.
